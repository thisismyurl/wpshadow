/**
 * Treatment: Re-enable the WordPress large-image scaling threshold
 *
 * Since WordPress 5.3, uploaded images wider than a configurable threshold
 * (default 2560 px) are automatically scaled down and the original is stored
 * as a "-scaled" variant. This prevents 10–20 MB DSLR and smartphone RAW-
 * quality uploads from being served to visitors.
 *
 * The threshold is controlled by the `big_image_size_threshold` filter. When
 * a theme or plugin returns `false` or `0` from this filter, the safeguard is
 * disabled and full-resolution originals accumulate in the media library and
 * get served on pages — increasing bandwidth and slowing loads.
 *
 * This treatment stores a flag and target threshold (2560 px) that tells the
 * WPShadow bootstrap to add a `big_image_size_threshold` filter at high
 * priority (999) restoring the default behaviour. This overrides any earlier
 * filter that disabled it.
 *
 * Note: the threshold only applies to future uploads. Existing oversized
 * images in the media library are not re-processed.
 *
 * Undo: deletes the stored value; bootstrap stops applying the override filter.
 *
 * @package WPShadow
 * @since   0.6093.1900
