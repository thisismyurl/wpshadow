 * Provides guidance for moving wp-config.php one directory above the

 * if wp-config.php is not found in ABSPATH, WordPress looks one level up.
 *
 * Moving wp-config.php above the web root prevents direct browser access to
 * the file even if your server's PHP engine fails (e.g. during an outage),
 * adding an extra layer of credential protection.
 *
 * This Is My URL Shadow does not move the file automatically because the new directory
 * must already exist and be writable, and the move must be verified
 * immediately before the old file is deleted.
 *
 * Risk level: n/a (guidance only — move manually)

					"Moving wp-config.php one level above the WordPress root hides it from direct browser access, even if PHP stops working.

Current location: %1\$s
Target location:  %2\$s

PREREQUISITES:
  • WordPress must be installed directly in the web root (not a subdirectory install).
  • %3\$s must be ABOVE the publicly accessible web root (e.g. public_html, htdocs).
  • If WordPress IS the web root, moving wp-config.php here exposes it to browsers — skip this step.

STEP 1 — Connect to your server via SFTP (FileZilla, Cyberduck, etc.) or cPanel File Manager.

STEP 2 — Copy (do NOT move yet) wp-config.php from:
    %1\$s
  To:
    %2\$s

STEP 3 — Test your site immediately. Visit your WordPress homepage AND wp-admin.
  If the site loads correctly, WordPress found the new location.

STEP 4 — Only after confirming the site works, delete the original file:
    %1\$s

STEP 5 — Re-run the This Is My URL Shadow scan to confirm this diagnostic is resolved.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
  If the site breaks after moving, copy wp-config.php back to %1\$s.
  WordPress may not support this layout if it is installed in a subdirectory or
  if another wp-config.php file already exists at %2\$s.

NOTE: This only works if %3\$s is not web-accessible.
  Verify by visiting http://yoursite.com/../wp-config.php — it must return 404, not file contents.",
