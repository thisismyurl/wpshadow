/**
 * Treatment Interface
 *
 * Defines the contract for treatment implementations. All treatments must implement
 * these methods to be recognized and executed by the This Is My URL Shadow system.
 *
 * **Architecture:**
 * Treatment system uses interface-based architecture:
 * - Treatment_Interface: Defines what methods treatments MUST implement
 * - Treatment_Base: Provides common implementation, extends interface
 * - Each treatment class: Implements interface via extending Treatment_Base
 *
 * **Why Interfaces Matter Here:**
 * - Ensures all treatments have consistent behavior
 * - Enables This Is My URL Shadow framework to treat all treatments uniformly
 * - Type safety: code that expects Treatment_Interface gets consistent behavior
 * - Future-proofing: new feature additions can be added to interface

/**
 * Interface for treatment/fix implementations
 *
 * Every treatment class must implement this interface to be recognized by the
 * This Is My URL Shadow framework. Use Treatment_Base instead of implementing directly.
 *
 * **Contract Requirements:**
 * - `get_finding_id()` - Returns diagnostic ID this treatment fixes
 * - `can_apply()` - Checks user permissions and environment compatibility
 * - `apply()` - Implements the actual fix (persistent change)
 * - `execute()` - Wrapper that calls apply() with hooks and logging
 *
 * **Implementation Example:**
 * ```php
 * class Treatment_My_Fix extends Treatment_Base {
 *     // Interface methods (inherited from Treatment_Base):
 *     public static function get_finding_id() { return 'my-check'; }
 *     public static function can_apply() {
 *         return parent::can_apply();
 *     }
 *     public static function apply() {
 *         // Your fix logic here
 *         return [ 'success' => true ];
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
