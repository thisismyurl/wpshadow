## Naming Standards

To maintain consistency in documentation, code, and communications:

### Official Names

| Product | Type | Always Called | Avoid Calling |
|---------|------|---------------|--------------|
| **WP Shadow** | Free WordPress Plugin | "WP Shadow", "the plugin", or "WPShadow" when referring to code namespaces | any unshipped product name |

### What Exists vs. What Is Planned

| Name | Status |
|------|--------|
| WP Shadow | Exists — free plugin |
| WPShadow Cloud | Reserved name only — not built |
| WPShadow Guardian | Reserved name only — not a shipped product |
| WPShadow Academy | Reserved name only — not built |
| WPShadow Vault | Reserved name only — not built |
| WPShadow Pro | Reserved name only — not built |
| WPShadow Theme | Reserved name only — not built |

### Code Namespace Standard
```php
// Current plugin namespace
namespace WPShadow\Core;
```

The PHP namespace remains `WPShadow\...` even though the public plugin name is written as "WP Shadow".

## Philosophy

WP Shadow's model is free whenever the feature runs locally on the user's own server and does not create ongoing infrastructure cost. If optional paid services are ever introduced, they should cover real service cost rather than gate the core plugin behind a paywall.

See [BUSINESS_MODEL.md](BUSINESS_MODEL.md) for the full model.
See [CORE_PHILOSOPHY.md](CORE_PHILOSOPHY.md) for guiding principles.
