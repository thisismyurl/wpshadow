This repository is the source for the first public beta.

- Status: Public beta
- Requires WordPress: 6.4+

## What Ships Today

This Is My URL Shadow currently exposes:

- 230 display-ready diagnostics across 11 categories via `Diagnostic_Registry::get_diagnostic_definitions()`.

## Source Of Truth

Public documentation should treat these as the authoritative count sources:

- the live inventory returned by `Diagnostic_Registry::get_diagnostic_definitions()`
- the treatment counts returned by `Treatment_Metadata::get_counts()`
- [docs/FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md)

Planning notes, archived reports, and placeholder code should not be used for headline totals.

## Accessibility And Privacy

This Is My URL Shadow is built for people who use keyboards, screen readers, zoom, reduced motion, simpler language, and lower-stress workflows. The docs should help a busy site owner understand what a finding means, what happens next, and how to recover if something goes wrong.

This Is My URL Shadow runs locally. The current beta does not require an account, does not require cloud infrastructure, and should not make unexpected third-party requests.
